# Via Labs V4 Message Gateway - Solana Implementation

A **complete production-ready** cross-chain messaging protocol for Solana using the Anchor framework. Features atomic two-transaction replay protection, three-layer security validation, and **enterprise-grade automated deployment system**.

## 🚀 Quick Start (New Enhanced Workflow)

### Complete Automated Deployment
```bash
# 1. Environment Setup
yarn env:generate localnet && yarn env:validate

# 2. Network Preparation
yarn network:prepare localnet && yarn network:validate localnet

# 3. One-Command Deployment 
yarn deploy:localnet

# 4. Post-Deployment Setup
yarn setup:localnet

# 5. Verification & Monitoring
yarn verify:localnet && yarn health:localnet --continuous
```

### Legacy Quick Start (Still Available)
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the program  
anchor build

# Run tests
anchor test

# Deploy to localnet
anchor deploy
```

## 🚀 **Enhanced Deployment System Features**

### Available Commands (25+ new npm scripts)
```bash
# Environment Management
yarn env:list                     # List environment profiles  
yarn env:generate <network>       # Generate network configuration
yarn env:validate                 # Validate environment setup

# Network Management
yarn network:list                 # Display configured networks
yarn network:prepare <network>    # Auto-generate keypairs and update configs
yarn network:validate <network>   # Check deployment requirements

# Deployment Operations  
yarn deploy:localnet              # Deploy to local development
yarn deploy:devnet                # Deploy to Solana devnet
